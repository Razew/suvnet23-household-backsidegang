# Opponering

## Purpose

You should humbly and constructively review a group's work and provide feedback on their results so that they can incorporate your feedback into their next project.

## Method

Everything will be done digitally. You will have access to the repository so that you can clone the project. Then, you will follow the README file to install and run the project.

Once the app is up and running, you can go through the flow and test the completed points. Consider whether the flow is easy to understand and what you think about the design choices for the different parts of the app. What would you like to keep and what would you like to change?

## Results

Structure your feedback based on the completed requirements and write your feedback under each requirement.

Write your feedback in markdown format and when you are done, create an issue on their repo with your feedback.

Name the issue as: "Review from group x"
